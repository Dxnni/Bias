Problem: People don't understand or are blind to biases that they/others have.
What does it do?: Our app highlights biases in opinion surrounding content online.
Benefit to User: 
- Users **see** biases that were previously unknown or assumed
- Users recognize their own biases and how they relate to others
- Tests for biases surrounding any issue


This is a prototype to display proof of concept.
The goal is to have users create and share Bias polls surrounding any topic and have the dynamic results displayed throughout social media through the use of a banner. Viewers can instantly see the results while scrolling their own social feeds and can decide to participate, share further, and create their own.


To view a prototype Bias page, open the "singe-page.html" file.
